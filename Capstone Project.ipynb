    "The process of finding a new house or apartment when moving can be lengthy and, specially when moving to a different city, costly due to several travels to the new city to visit potential new houses indicated by the real estate companies.<br>\n",
    "In this notebook we propose a way of shortening this process by using data about the most popular venues of each neighborhood of a given city to find their \"venue profile\".\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Target audience:</b><br>\n",
    "Analyzes like the one we will present here may be useful to real estate companies. They can make a short interview, or use a web-based form, to determine what is the \"venue profile\" that each client prefers and them suggest houses located in neighborhoods with \"venues profile\" that matches the client's preferences.<br>\n",
    "Accelerating the process of matching clients with houses with which they will be satisfied benefits both sides: It is beneficial to the real estate company because it increases the chances of closing deals before its competitors and to the client because it saves their time and money due to less visits to houses suggested by the real estate company in which they don't really have interest.<br><br>\n",
    "The analysis we will show here is general and can be applied to any city. In this notebook, we will use the city of Ribeir達o Preto, one of the largest of the State of S達o Paulo, Brazil."
